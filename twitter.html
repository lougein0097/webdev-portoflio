		<p> Twitter is a social media app that allows its users to blog about their opinions, lives and other interests. This is done by short posts that are called tweets, which consists of 120 words. Tweets can be retweeted which means that your followers can see that tweet on their timeline, tweets can also be favorited and you can reply to a tweet with your own tweet. Like any other social media app Twitter requires its users to contribute, if you follow a user you can see their posts on your timeline.

		<p>A main part of twitter is the use of Hashtags (#), this is used before a phrase in their tweets to highlight the topic or idea in that tweet, this helps sort out that tweet to that particular topic and helps them show more easily in the search bar. Clicking on a hashtag will bring you to all the tweets related to that word and topic.</p>

		<p> This can be really useful in learning and teaching, as you can easily find what you are looking for using the hashtags. For example #coding can be really useful for a beginner CDM student as there can be useful websites and tips posted by other users. Twitter can be a really useful place for learning and teaching.

			<h3> Twitter requires its users to be at least 13 years old, twitter does not keep tweets of people under the age of 13. This rule was made as some people tweet about sensitive matters with sensitive images that young children should not see. Accounts have to be verified and users have to acknowledge they want to view the sensitive content and if their account is verified to be over the age limit then they can view it.</h3>
