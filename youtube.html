		<p> Youtube is a simple social media app that includes videos in a range of file formats that are uploaded by its users. The success of the app can be contributed to its easy accessibility to the average internet user. The benefit of youtube is that the range of content that it has, youtube has something for everyone, if you are trying to relax and watch a podcast or learn how to do a maths question youtube has it all. I believe youtube is an amazing place for learning, I myself have used youtube for math questions, explanations for biology and geography, when I was in school. </p>

		<p> I saw myself retaining a lot more information while watching videos rather than just reading the content off, the benefit of videos is that you can replay the video many times if you don't understand. For example if you are trying to find a formula or learn the process needed to carry out a sum, you seach your topic and many video tutorials come up to teach step by step how to carry it out.

		<p>Youtube can be very beneficial between a teacher and student, the teacher can upload a video explaining a theory or briefing the student on a certain topic, this also helps the students who might have missed a lecture, or students who haven't understood an assignment to go over it once more so that they understand everything properly. Studies have shown that visual videos with explanations are more likely to help learn a concept faster.
