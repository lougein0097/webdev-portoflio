		<p> Slack is a free messaging app that is mainly created for workplaces and group work activities, the app lets you have both one-to-one and group discussions. Slack lets you share links and files with others, it also allows the integration of other apps and services. This can be useful if you are assigned a task in a group that is working on the same thing. Slack can help brainstorm ideas and create a plan before starting a set task, this can be useful in that everyone is on the same page and has an overview of the plan. colleagues can voice their opinions on a certain task, or ask for help if they are not sure about an assignment. Slack is very easy to join and get going, there are fun little settings that you can do, like changing themes for crossbar, messages and emoji style.</p>

		<p> Slack is an amazing social media tool that is useful for communication between students and teachers. It is a great place for discussing problems and its solutions in groups, in other words it's a breeding ground for team work. Each person can contribute their idea to the group, by messaging into a chat created by the users. Unlike other social media apps/ tools used for education, slack is way more casual, letting students be more comfortable with the way they can speak.</p>

		<p> As we see it is easily accessible, you can just search the topic in a form of a hashtag and it will come up as a thread. Students can then join that thread and can talk about that topic with peer students, they can ask for help, questions, plan things, do whatever they want using this tool. Sometimes teachers join these threads too to make the process of teaching and learning more fun. This can be very useful as at times social media apps have their content all over the place, and it can be hard to find the exact thing that you are looking for.

		<p> Here we see our lecturer post an announcement about one of our modules: studio photography- image manipulation. From here students can ask questions about the assignment and the professor could answer any questions and clear up anything that could be confusing. Students can also discuss ideas amongst themselves regarding the project, this creates a community of students willing to learn and grow.

			<h3>Slack has shown to have had some security concerns in the past, this is due to the weakness in their code. If slack accounts have not properly on-boarded or off-boarded their accounts after their affiliation with that company or organisation, the users can gain sensitive or confidential information that can be used against that company.  </h3>
