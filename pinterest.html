		<p> Users can save Pins on their individual Boards on your profile. A user can also invite others to work on a group board, which encourages group work and increases productivity. I believe pinterest can be used in the teaching environment, it differentiates from other normal teaching methods, it brings in more visual learning. Many case studies show that visual learning helps us to better retrieve and remember information as our brains are image processors, and the main part of our brains are the sensory cortex which relates to vision.

		<p> Users can also  search for a certain topic and all articles, images related to that topic will come up under categories like 'Games - DIY - Quotes' etc and the users gets to pick whatever category they are interested in. This is a very useful process. </p>

			<h3>Pinterest also has an age limit of 13 years old, this rule was made as some people share explicit information/ images which is not suitable for children. Content like this is not allowed to be posted and is against the terms and conditions of pinterest but it takes days to weeks for it to be taken down when it gets enough reports. </h3>
