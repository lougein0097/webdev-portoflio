			<h3>Reddit has been in controversies for banning certain subreddits, for their controversial and explicit content. Reddits CEO Yishan Wong stated that “we stand for free speech” and they will not ban legal content even if they find it explicit or they personally don't like it. Reddit was in controversy when a subreddit was discovered with revealing photos of underrage girls without their consent. Reddit can often have explicit content that is not suitable for certain ages that are looking to use reddit for educational purposes.</h3>
