		<p> Google classroom is not like other social media tools, it is created solely for the purpose of teaching and learning, a connection between teachers and their students. It allows for teachers to create an online class, where a teacher can post assignments and have one-on-one feedback with the students, teachers can also provide a grade for their work that has been assigned to them. Teachers can set a certain task with a deadline, resources such as links, powerpoint presentations and announcements can also be added. This type of learning can be essential for certain subjects as a lot of material is online based. Google classroom can be very effective in learning as it keeps a constant communication between student and teacher even after a lecture or class. Students can also ask questions if they do not particularly understand an assignment or task, students can also give their feedback on teaching techniques.</p>

		<p> For Teaching purposes the teacher can make a class where they can upload whatever material they want to share with students, they will get a code with which they will have to share with their students so that only those students from that particular class can join. Teachers can create a feedback section for students. Students can access the classroom by using the code they are supplied with by the teacher and can read and learn from all the information the teacher is uploading, they can give feedback or ask questions if needed.</p>

	<div id="description">

		<p> After students join classes the classes will be laid out on the page for them to choose what class they want to look at and when they want to look at it. Information like the subject and teacherâ€™s name will be in each subsection making it easier for the student to know which class is which.</p>

		<p> Teachers (and or students when permission is given by the teacher) can post on the virtual class with whatever information they want to share, questions, feedback, comments etc. </p>

			<h3>Google classroom is one of the safer educational apps as the teacher has to share the code to their class for them to be able to get into the class. These codes are not to be shared with anyone but the students of that class. Teachers always have the power to remove someone from the class.</h3>
